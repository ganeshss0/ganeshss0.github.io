- Understand the data obtained from research teams and then further conduct comprehensive data cleaning and meticulous EDA. 

- Formulate experiments to check the possibility and usability of the data obtained from all teams. 

- Beat the baseline accuracy for one team. I am currently in the process of doing the same for all teams and improving accuracy gradually. 

## Projects
### Flight Fare Prediction
[Deployment](https://flight-fare.streamlit.app) | 
[Repository](https://github.com/ganeshss0/flight-fare-prediction)

* The objective of the project was to predict the fare of flight based on the inputs given from the user. 

* As it was a regression problem, ML modelling was started with **LightGBM** regression. During feature engineering, four new features were derived which represented the data in a better way and improved the model performance. Then **XGBOOST** and **Random Forest** were also tested, and random forest turned out to be most accurate.
